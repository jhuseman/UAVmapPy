# UAVmapPy

This is partial code for a system using the DJI Tello drone to map out a space using the onboard camera and image recognition.  This was developed as part of the weekend-long "IrishHacks" hackathon sponsored by AT&T and the University of Notre Dame.  Due to time constraints, the project was only able to locate a small subset of objects in the space below the drone, but with further extension, the project could be used to identify the location of objects in an area by flying around the area, then plotting these objects on a map.

For the code specifically related to locating objects beneath the drone, see the branch "tello_control".
